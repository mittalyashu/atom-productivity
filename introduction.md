**The short answer**

The final version of this book will assume you’re using the latest version of [Atom](https://atom.io/). But right now we’re in …

## Conventions {#conventions}

### Why are you telling me to click stuff in menus? {#why-are-you-telling-me-to-click-stuff-in-menus}

I love keyboard shortcuts, and Sublime has dozens of great ones. but you won’t find many in the front part of the book. Why is that?

In earlier versions of the book, I tried to include the keyboard shortcuts along with the step-by-step instructions. It was repetitive and clumsy, because Sublime’s shortcuts differ radically between the Windows and Linux versions and the OS X versions.

It clutters the reading experience to include keyboard shortcuts, because they’re different for each operating system.

The menus, on the other hand, are more consistent across platforms. The menus are also more discoverable: If you forget a keyboard shortcut, it’s pretty hard to figure out where to find it. But the menus are all there for you to explore. Plus the menus generally include the keyboard shortcuts, so you can often learn the keyboard shortcut if you know where a feature is in the menu.

So even though I firmly believe you should learn the keyboard shortcuts for features you use frequently, I decided that I’d use the menu options where they are available. If there’s no way to do something via the menu, I’ll fall back to the Command Palette, and I’ll only specifically list a keyboard shortcut if there’s no other way to accomplish a task.

Mainly give menu-driven instructions to make cross-platform instructions more succinct.

### Hey, where are the keyboard shortcuts? {#hey-where-are-the-keyboard-shortcuts}

Instead of including the keyboard shortcuts in the main portion of the book, I’m in the process of compiling a curated list of the most useful keyboard shortcuts, which will be available in the back of the book.

### Formatting notes {#formatting-notes}

When I’m providing a walkthrough, things you need to click or execute are in **bold**.

Text you should enter is listed in `fixed-width font`, as are file paths, names and extensions, and code.
